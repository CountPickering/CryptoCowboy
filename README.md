This is all my raw data dumped. It has not been cleaned up or organized so it's not meant to be used as is. It's for people who want to sift through my code for ideas or sample code.

Use at your own risk. I will be cleaning it up over the next few weeks. I recomend not running this unless you understand what every line of code is doing.
